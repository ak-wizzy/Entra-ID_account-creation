## ðŸ“‹ CSV Template Format

**What the Script Does**
Creates each user in Entra ID with a temporary password.

Assigns job title, department, and usage location.

Sets their manager if ManagerUPN is specified.

Adds the user to one or more groups (and creates the group if missing).

**ðŸš¨ Notes**
Make sure you have appropriate admin permissions.

Double-check the UPNs and group names to avoid duplication or errors.

Newly created accounts will require the user to change their password at first sign-in
